    <H1 style="color: red;"><u>HOW TO MAKE BASIC COOKIES IN 32 MINS</u></H1>
    <P>Bake a batch of these easy <em><b>cookies</b></em> with just five ingredients - or fewer.<BR> A perfect partner to a cup of tea, you can whip them up in no time.</P>
    
    <h3 style="color:red ;">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>225g butter, softened</li>
    <li>110g caster sugar</li>
    <li>275g plain flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp cinnamon or other spices (optional)</li>
    <li>75g white or milk chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 style="color: red;">Method</h3>
    <ol>
    <strong><li></li></strong>Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Cream the butter in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer until it is soft.
    <br> Add the sugar and keep beating until the mixture is light and fluffy. Sift in the flour and add the optional ingredients, if you’re using them. <br> Bring the mixture together with your hands in a figure-of-eight motion until it forms a dough. You can freeze the dough at this point.</li><br><br>
    <strong><li></li></strong>Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them slightly apart from each other on a baking sheet (you don’t need to butter or line it). <br> Flatten the balls a little with the palm of your hand and bake them in the oven for around 10-12 mins until they are golden brown and slightly firm on top. <br> Leave the cookies on a cooling rack for around 15 mins before serving.</li></P>
